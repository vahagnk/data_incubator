  _size.Rmd_ script illustrates the relation between stock return and the company's size. The data contains common stocks pricing data for 1970-2012 period (excluding the financial companies). For each month we construct 10 decile portfolios based on the size of the company (Size=SharePrice x NumberOfSharesOutstanding). The decile portfolio returns show that the smaller companies tend to have higher returns.
